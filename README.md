# MIMO Radar Reinforcement Learning Environment

This project represents the use of a reinforcement learning environment implemented from scratch on Python in conglomeration with a MIMO radar environment. The calculations done for this project were primarly done on MATLAB, and the data between the Python and MATLAB files were used together.
